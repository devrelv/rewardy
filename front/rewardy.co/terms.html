    <h1>Rewardy Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Published on: Oct 4, 2016</p>

    <p>Welcome to Rewardy ("Rewardy," "we," or "us"). This text explains the terms by which you may use our online and mobile services, websites <a href="http://www.undermyfork.com">www.undermyfork.com</a> and <a href="http://www.rewardy.co">www.rewardy.co</a>, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the "Services"). These Services are designed to help people eat healthy. By accessing or using these Services, you acknowledge and agree to these Terms of Service (the "Terms") and the Rewardy Privacy Policy. These Terms apply to all users of these Services.  If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use these Services.</p>

    <h3>Who May Use the Services</h3>
    <p>You may use these Services only if you are not barred from using these Services under your local law. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THESE SERVICES. Children between the ages of 13 and 18 may use these Services only with the permission and active involvement of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

    <h3>Registration and Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>If you want to use these Services you will have to find our chat bot "Rewardy" in Facebook Messenger, Telegram or Kik and start chatting with this chat bot. You don't need any special registration to use our Services. If you are a Facebook user, we will use certain personal information from your Facebook account such as your name, age, sex, country, and possibly other personal information that your privacy settings on your Facebook account permit us to access.</p>

    <h3>Rewardy Services</h3>
    <p>Rewardy is a mobile communication platform that uses a chat bot "Rewardy" to help you change unhealthy eating habits by keeping a virtual food diary for you and sharing it with your friends and/or professional trainer/nutrition consultant ("trainer"). These Services allow you to communicate with the chat bot by sending a text message or a photo describing the food or drinks you have consumed throughout the day. The chat bot will react to your messages depending on what you specified as your desired goal; e.g. to gain weight, lose weight, or just healthy eating. Your virtual food diary will be formed based on your messages sent to the chat bot, and will be available to you at any time. You can also share your virtual food diary with your friends or your trainer who will be able to comment on your eating habits and adjust your diet accordingly. Our chat bot will communicate with you in an easy and friendly manner. For example, if you mentioned that you ate a high-calorie dessert for dinner, our chat bot may answer: " Your favorite jeans aren't going to fit if you keep eating like that." If this manner of communication bothers you, please refrain from using our Services.</p>
