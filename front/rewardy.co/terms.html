    <p>10.1 The Rewardy Services allow the submission of content and materials (such as pictures, reviews, ratings, ideas, or notes)
        by you and other Users (&quot;User Submissions&quot;), and the hosting, sharing and/or publishing of such User Submissions.
        You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In
        connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and warrant that: (i) you own, or have the necessary licenses,
        rights, consents, and permissions to use, and authorize Rewardy to use, all intellectual property and any other proprietary

        and every identifiable individual person in the User Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable
        individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Rewardy Services

        User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Rewardy Services and under this Agreement.</p>
    
    <p>10.3 You understand that when using the Rewardy Services you will be exposed to User Submissions from a variety of sources,
        and that Rewardy is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating
        to such User Submissions. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Submissions that are
        inaccurate, offensive, indecent or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable
        rights or remedies you have or may have against Rewardy with respect thereto.</p>

        whether or not such User Submissions are published, Rewardy does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any
        User Submissions. Rewardy assumes no responsibility for actively monitoring User Submissions for inappropriate content.
        If at any time Rewardy chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor User Submissions, Rewardy nonetheless assumes no responsibility
        for the content of the User Submissions, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate User Submissions, and no
        responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting User Submissions. Further, Rewardy does not endorse and has no
        control over the content of User Submissions submitted by other Users. Rewardy makes no warranties, express or implied,
        as to the content of User Submissions or the accuracy and reliability of any User Submissions. Nonetheless, Rewardy reserves
        the right to prevent you from submitting User Submissions and to edit, restrict or remove User Submissions for any reason
        at any time.</p>

    <p>11.4 In addition, even if Rewardy handles the billing, payment processing and/or fulfillment for the third-party service
