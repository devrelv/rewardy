    <h1>Rewardy Privacy Policy</h1>
     
    <p>Rewardy is a marketing service company focusing on the chat bot marketplace. We are committed to maintaining the privacy
    of your information when you visit our website, and when we provide products that optimize the mobile marketplace inclusive
    of ads and app download environments, on behalf of our mobile application provider clients ("Clients"). This Privacy Policy
    describes how we treat the personal information received about you on this website, www.rewardy.co (our "Website"), and when
    providing marketing services to our application publisher Clients (our "Services"). </p>
    

    <p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This policy describes what kinds of information we collect, its use, and
    how it is shared. As these Services are available on Viber, Kik, Facebook Messenger and Telegram, we comply with all their
    requirements concerning protecting the users' personal information.</p>
 
    <p>Rewardy Website</p>
    
    <p>When you use certain features of our Website, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include
        your email address and mobile phone number. We automatically collect non-personally identifiable information such as
        IP addresses and website usage information from you when you visit our Website. Except as specifically set forth in this
        Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Rewardy.</p>
    
    <p>We may disclose and use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce our Terms
        of Service (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third party&#39;s intellectual property or proprietary rights),
        or to alert you to changes in our policies or agreements that may affect your use of our Website. We may also disclose
        personally identifiable information when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection
        with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the Website, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law
        requires us to do so.</p>
    
    <p>Rewardy Application Marketing Service</p>
    
    <p>Rewardy buys mobile advertising space on behalf of our Clients which are generally mobile application providers and companies
        looking to advertise via mobile applications. When you click on a Client ad or application link delivered by Rewardy,
        Rewardy servers receive and store a mobile identifier (&quot;Mobile ID&quot;) which is a pseudonymous number that is
        associated with your mobile device. Rewardy cannot use the Mobile ID to identify you personally, but it does enable us
        to deliver relevant advertising to each mobile device. In addition to the Mobile ID, we collect information about the
        kind of mobile device you use (e.g., iPhone, Samsung), the operating system for your mobile device (e.g., Android, Apple
        O/S), IP address, the applications you download from Rewardy Clients, when, how, and how often you use those applications.</p>
    
    <p>We use your device&#39;s Mobile ID and other information about Client applications you download to help our clients understand
        which ads are most effective at generating downloads of our Client&#39;s applications. We also use your Mobile ID and
        the information associated with your device Mobile ID over time (e.g., the applications you download, when and how you
        use those applications, and any publisher-provided demographic data) to enhance our services and to select Rewardy Client
        ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.</p>
    
    <p>Rewardy may use agents and contractors in order to provide our services to Clients. If such agents and contractors have access
        to your Mobile ID and/or the information associated with your Mobile ID, they are required to protect this information
        in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other
        than to carry out the services they are performing for Rewardy.</p>
    
    <p>Information Sharing, Onward Transfer</p>
    
    <p>We disclose the information in our systems, including your Mobile ID and/or the information associated with your Mobile ID

        <li>In response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);</li>
        <li>When we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some
            or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.</li>
        <li>In other circumstances when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Rewardy, Rewardy Clients, and third
            parties.
