    <h1>Forksy Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Published on: May 4, 2016</p>

    <p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us. This policy describes what kinds of information we collect, its use, and how it is shared.
    As these Services are available on Facebook Messenger and Telegram, we comply with all Facebook and Telegram requirements concerning protecting the users' personal information.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>Information you provide to us directly: When you start using Forksy, we will ask you about your weight, height, sex, age, location, food allergies and your desired nutritional goals (e.g. to gain weight, to lose weight, etc.). In the future, we will collect the names of the food you will provide to us through interacting with our chat bot, and include them in your virtual food diary.
    Information from third parties: When you start using Forksy on Facebook Messenger, we will receive information from your Facebook account such as your name, age, sex, country, your Facebook user ID, and possibly other personal information that your privacy settings on your Facebook account permit us to access. When you start using Forksy on Telegram, we will receive your Telegram user ID and username.
    Feel free to decline to give us any information that we request, however, please note that doing so may make it impossible for Forksy to provide you these Services to the full extent.</p>

    <h3>Use of Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We only use the information that we collect to provide, improve, and develop these Services.
    We may conduct surveys and research, test features currently in development, and analyze the information we have to improve these Services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.</p>

    <h3>Sharing of Your Information</h3>
    <p>You can share your virtual food diary with your friends and your trainer. If you do so, your friends and/or your trainer will be able to comment on your meals and give you advice.</p>

    <p>We do not and will not, without your explicit consent, share your personal information, including your virtual food diary, with any other third parties except as described below:
    We may share aggregated, anonymized information with third parties for market research and analysis, marketing and promoting these Services, and other similar purposes.
    We may provide access to personal information to Forksy employees, contractors, and agents who need specific information for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. All of these individuals and entities are subjected to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be held liable if they fail to meet these obligations.
    We may share data with government agencies to satisfy applicable law, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests.</p>


    <h3>How We Store and Protect Your Information</h3>
    <p>We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide these Services to you. Information associated with your use of these Services will be kept until your contact to the chat bot "Forksy" is deleted, unless we no longer need the data to provide these Services.
    We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>

    <h3>Modifying or Deleting Your Information</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions about modifying or deleting your information or your contact to the chat bot "Forksy", you can contact us directly at <a href="mailto:policy@getforksy.com">policy@getforksy.com</a>. Forksy may retain your information for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.</p>

    <h3>International Transfer</h3>
    <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Hereby you explicitly grant us your consent to any international transmission of your personal information for the purpose of providing these Services.</p>

    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
    <p>We may, in our sole discretion, modify this policy at any time, and it is your responsibility to review this policy for any changes. Your continued use of our Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
